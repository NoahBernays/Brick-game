Code for brick game

Initial description of game:
There is a paddle horizontal to the x-axis at the bottom and an array of bricks at the top.
A ball travels at constant velocity. When it hits the paddle, it bounces off at the opposite angle of incidence back up towards the bricks. When a ball hits a brick, the brick disappears. When all the bricks are destroyed, you move on to another level with a new array of bricks.
You begin with x amount of lives.
When the ball falls past your paddle, you lose a life.

Eventually:
-Create cool patterns with the bricks (not just rectangles)
-Have upgrade packages that fall from random bricks that change the game when you catch them with the paddle (extra balls, extra lives, longer paddle, shorter paddle, firepower)
-pop-up messages when you die or move up a level
